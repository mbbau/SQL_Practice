# SQL Practice

## Introduction

In this repository, I will store my answers and notes for the SQL exercises of complex topics using the [AdventureWorks 2019 dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms). All the work is based in the Udemy Course called ["The Advanced SQL Server Masterclass For Data Analysis"](https://www.udemy.com/share/104Od23@rKxQZQyo2g23LNvR2QAnhd3j4gzS7NKmDhUg0J4EoTtFLc_kIgSy7fVvSmsusTuj5g==/) by Travis Cuzick.

## Advanced Analysis with Window Functions

In this section of the course window functions are presented. Window functions are usefull in order to make agregate functions without losing all the data in the table in order to gain row level detail of the aggregation that is being done.
In the next [link](https://github.com/mbbau/SQL_Practice/tree/main/Section%202%20-%20Advanced%20Analysis%20with%20window%20functions) you will find solved execerises using window functions with the dataset mentioned in the introduction.
