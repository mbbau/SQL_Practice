# SQL Practice

## Introduction

In this repository, I will store my answers and notes for the SQL exercises of complex topics using the [AdventureWorks 2019 dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms). All the work is based in the Udemy Course called ["The Advanced SQL Server Masterclass For Data Analysis"](https://www.udemy.com/share/104Od23@rKxQZQyo2g23LNvR2QAnhd3j4gzS7NKmDhUg0J4EoTtFLc_kIgSy7fVvSmsusTuj5g==/) by Travis Cuzick.
